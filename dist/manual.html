        <h3>Study Customization</h3>

        <div class="faq-container">
          <div class="faq-question">
            Which study components can I customize?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              You can select the language of the audio instructions, the webcam
              recording, the number of trials, the study background, and the
              displayed agents. The study always shows an agent looking out of a
              window. In front of them, there is a balloon (red, yellow, green
              or blue) that falls to the ground. Depending on the trial type,
              the balloon flight will be visible or (partially) covered by a
              hedge.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-question">What is the default selection?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              The default settings always present one trial of training 1, two
              trials of training 2, and 16 test trials. Please note that the
              first trial of each kind plays voice-over instructions. The
              background and the agents depend on the selected language and
              match what we chose in our cross-cultural gaze understanding study
              (Bohn, Prein et al., 2024). Visit the
              <a href="./customize.html">Customization page</a>
              and hover over the agent images to see their IDs.

            In the language selection, what does the option "custom" mean?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              We added this language selection to offer you even more
              flexibility. If you work with an offline version of the TANGO-CC
              and have downloaded the "dist" folder, you can exchange the audio
              recordings in the folder "sounds", and then "custom" with whatever
              mp3 files you want. The only requirement is that it matches the
              naming of the placeholder mp3s within the "custom" folder. If you
              then start the live server and open the task, select language:
              custom and the task will play your own mp3s! Please note that
              trials with audio instructions wait with their animation until the
              audio recording is finished. Therefore, if the audio recording is
              too long and contains pauses, the trial might seem to be stuck.

            <p>
              You can enter any number between 1 and 100. Please note that the
              first trial of each kind plays voice-over instructions, so you
              will probably want to exclude the first trial of each kind from
              your analysis.

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              If you want to add other features to the TANGO-CC, you can do so
              by editing the code. Please visit our public GitHub repository:
              <a href="https://github.com/jprein/tango-pwa/"
                >https://github.com/jprein/tango-pwa/</a

                >git clone git@github.com:jprein/tango-pwa/.git</code
              >) and start experimenting! Please note that we cannot offer
              individual coding counselling or website hosting for your own
              version of the task. We developed this task on macOS and use
              features for Unix-like operating systems (e.g., rsync). If you are
              working on a Windows device, you might need to adjust some of the
              code.

          <h3>Study Design</h3>

          <div class="faq-question">
            What is the difference between the trial types?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              The training trials are meant to familiarize the participants with
              the task. The first training trial shows a balloon that falls from
              the center to a random position on the ground. The participant is
              asked to click on the visible balloon. The second training trial
              shows a balloon that again falls to a random position on the
              ground, but this time the end position of the balloon is covered
              by a hedge. The participant sees the direction of the balloon
              flight, but not the exact end position. They are then asked to
              click on hedge, where they think the hidden balloon is. In the
              test trials, the balloon falls to a random location on the ground,
              while the whole balloon flight is covered by the hedge. The test
              trials are probably the ones that you will want to analyze.

          </div>

          <div class="faq-question">
            Can I skip a study phase (e.g., training 1)?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              No, you cannot. Each study phase is necessary to understand the
              task and needs to be completed before the next phase starts.
              Please note that the first trial of each kind plays voice-over
              instructions.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-question">
            Which components of the study will be randomized?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              The order of the agents, balloon colors (red, yellow, green,
              blue), and balloon positions are each randomized independently.
              For the balloon positions, the full width of the screen (1920 in
              "SVG unit") is divided into ten bins. Exact coordinates (value
              between 0 far left and 1920 far right) within each bin are then
              randomly generated. The number of repetitions for each agent,
              balloon color, and balloon bin is calculated based on the total
              number of trials and the number of unique agents, balloon colors,
              and bins, respectively. All agents, balloon colors, and bins
              appear equally often and are not repeated in more than two
              consecutive trials. If the total number of trials is not divisible
              by the number of unique elements, additional elements are randomly
              selected to make up for the remainder. This ensures a balanced and
              random distribution of agents, balloon colors, and bins across
              trials. The randomized elements and their positions are logged for
              each trial, providing a detailed record of the experimental
              conditions.

          <div class="faq-question">
            Why are the written instructions only in English?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              No matter which language you choose, the written text instructions
              will always be in English. Only the audio recordings change
              according to your language selection. This design choice has four
              main reasons:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>We wanted to keep things manageable!</li>
              <li>
                The text instructions are only meant for the experimenters,
                leading the participants (e.g., children who cannot read)
                through the study.
              </li>
              <li>
                The content of the text instructions is kept to the bare
                minimum. It is rather meant as a chance to pause between the
                different trial types.
              </li>
              <li>
                Some of the communities in which we conducted our cross-cultural
                study (see Further reading) do not rely on written text that
                much / at all.

          <div class="faq-question">
            How did you guide children through the study?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              When we collected child data for our study, a study leader guided
              the children through the study. Here are the guidelines we used
              for our data collection:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                In short: don't give directions, don't point to any box/place,
                no direct right/wrong as feedback.
              </li>
              <li>
                Briefly tell the children something like "Look, there are some
                children and balloons in the picture. We're about to play with
                them! A voice always explains to us what is about to happen.
                Let's listen to it together!"
              </li>
              <li>
                Between the trial types (i.e. whenever there is a text slide in
                between), you can say something like: "Great! We'll continue
                playing in a moment. The game changes a bit and the voice will
                explain it again. Come on, let's listen to it together!"
              </li>
              <li>
                To direct attention back, "Look what's happening!" / "Well,
                where is the balloon?" / "Look at that animal there" etc.
              </li>
              <li>
                In between, e.g. to motivate the children, you can always say
                "Super" / "great" / etc. between trials. Don't praise the
                response of the children directly, but the
                participation/attention overall.
              </li>
              <li>
                When kids ask where to click, say something like "Where's the
                balloon?" / "Show me where the balloon is".
              </li>
              <li>
                When children ask if they should click in a certain place / if
                it's right: "Press where you think the balloon is" / "Whatever
                you think" etc. No direct feedback, please! Feel free to praise
                the children in general, but don't tell them if it was right or
                not.
              </li>

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              Yes, there are. The participants can only click the screen after
              the voice recording stopped playing. If they click before, nothing
              will happen. If they do not click within 5 seconds, the voice
              recording will remind them to please touch the screen. The
              participants can only click on the lower part of the screen. If
              they click on the upper part (e.g., on the person in the window),
              nothing will happen.

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              No, participants see a small orange circle where they clicked and
              hear a short sound, but they do not get any feedback on whether
              their response was correct or not. We decided against feedback
              because we wanted to keep the trials in the task as comparable as
              possible.

          <h3>Study Requirements</h3>

          <div class="faq-question">
            Does TANGO have any screen size or resolution requirements?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              The task does not require a certain screen size. It even runs on
              smartphones. However, we would recommend a bigger screen for
              better handling and touch precision. What you do need is either a
              working internet connection or installing the TANGO-CC as a
              Progressive Web App (PWA) that can run without internet. For
              further information, see the section on Technical Setup.

            Do my participants need to have experience with computers or

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              No, they do not. The task is designed to be intuitive and easy to
              understand. The only requirement is that the participants can see
              the screen and touch it. If you are working with children, you
              might want to read the section "How did you guide children through
              the study?". What might help is to explain to the participants
              that there will be a computer voice that guides them through the
              study and that they should pay attention to this instruction. You
              can also practice touching the tablet before you start the study.

            What are your experiences with different age ranges completing the

              We have collected data from participants between 3 and 80 years of
              age. The task seems to be fun for most and easy to understand.
              What we noticed is that some of the very young children tend to
              click in the center of the screen. So if you gathered a similar
              experience, you're not alone!

              We collected data from Argentina, China, Rep. Congo, Germany,
              India, Mexico, Namibia, New Zealand, Nigeria, Zambia, TÃ¼rkiye,
              Uganda, UK, USA. The task runs smoothly and children from all
              settings seemed to enjoy the task. Some children needed to get
              familiar with touching the screen, but this was not a problem (see
              question "Do my participants need to have experience with
              computers or touchscreens?"). You can read more about this in our

              First of all: we do not use cookies or upload any data to our
              servers. The data that is collected during the study (e.g., click
              coordinates, randomization, webcam video) will be downloaded to
              your device and is fully deleted from the browser once you close
              your browser window. This means we cannot access any of the data
              that you/your participants enter.

            <p>
              After you/your participant finished the last trial, a CSV file
              will be downloaded to your device. If you also selected the webcam
              recording, a WEBM file will also be downloaded to your device. The
              files will be stored in your Downloads folder (or the path you
              personally specified in your browser settings). The file name
              follows the pattern: "tangoCC-participantID-YYYY-MM-DD_hh_mm_ss".

              In two recent studies, we tested the reliability and internal
              consistency of the TANGO. First, we worked with a German sample,
              then we tested the generalizability of the task in a big
              cross-cultural data set. We found that the task is able to capture
              individual differences in children as well as adults. High
              internal consistency and test-retest reliability estimates
              underline that the captured variation is systematic. You can read
              more about this in our papers:

          <h3>Technical Setup</h3>

          <div class="faq-question">
            How do you pass on the selected options to the study website?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              We use the browser's local storage to pass on the selected options
              to the study website. When you make a selection (e.g. language or
              agents' faces), it is saved in local storage using JavaScript.
              When you pass through all pages in the intended order, all study
              choices will be set and saved in the local storage. When you skip
              a page and directly go to the study page (tango.html), some study
              choices might be missing and sensible default values will be set.
              This ensures that the study can still run smoothly even if some
              selections are skipped.
            </p>

          <div class="faq-question">
            I want to collect data of several participants using the same
            language and stimuli settings. Can the website save my selected,
            customized study options?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              Yes, it can! The website saves the selected study options in the
              browser's local storage. This means that if you open the website
              on the same device and browser, the selected options will be
              remembered. However, please note that this only works if you do
              not clear (i.e., delete) your browser's cache or local storage. If
              you want to collect data from several participants using the same
              study settings, simply open the website on the same device and
              browser, and the selected options will be automatically applied.
              We recommend going through the customization process once and then
              saving the page where you are asked to enter the participant ID as
              a bookmark:
              <a href="https://devpsy.web.leuphana.de/tango-pwa/id.html"
                >https://devpsy.web.leuphana.de/tango-pwa/id.html</a
              >.This way, you can easily access the study with the same
              customization options but enter new participant IDs each time.

          <div class="faq-question">
            Do I need to finish the study in order to download the data?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              The automatic download only gets triggered after all trials are
              completed. However, you can open the browser console (e.g.,
              right-click on some element on the website and click "Inspect")
              and download the data manually at any point during the study. For
              this, you simply need to enter the command
              <code>downloadCsv()</code> in the console and press enter. The
              data will then be downloaded to your device. Some browsers might
              ask you to confirm the download. The trials which were not
              completed yet will contain some empty columns in the CSV. You can
              do the same with the webcam recording by entering
              <code>downloadWebm()</code> in the console.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-question">Can I let the study run offline?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              Yes, you can! The TANGO-CC website is a Progressive Web App (PWA),
              which allows you to run the study offline without requiring a live
              is a type of web application that can be installed on your device
              and run offline like a native application. It caches the necessary
              you will need to reload the website while connected to the
              internet to cache the resources again. This ensures that the PWA
              can function offline properly.
            </p>
            <p>
              To use the PWA, simply visit the TANGO-CC website. Once the page
              is fully loaded, you will see a pop-up menu informing you that the
              website is ready to run offline. To install the app, the next
              steps depend on the browser you use. To see how you can download
              the PWA in Google Chrome or Safari, see the screenshots below.
              Once the PWA is installed, the TANGO-CC will be available directly
              on your device's home screen or applications folder, just like a
              native app.

          <div class="faq-question">
            Can I upload TANGO-CC data to my own server?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              Yes, you could. However, this requires some technical setup and
              programming knowledge. You can download the source code from
              TANGO-CC online (<a
                href="https://github.com/jprein/tango-pwa/tree/main/dist"
                target="_blank"
                >GitHub</a
              >). Then, you would need to adapt the "downloadData.js" function
              and change it to an upload. We did this in the past by using this
              JavaScript code (note that we upload a .json file instead of a
              .csv file):
            </p>

            <pre>
              <code>
  function uploadData (safe, ID) => {
    fetch('data/data.php', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({ data: JSON.stringify(safe), fname: ID }),
    })
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((data) => { console.log('Success:', data) })
      .catch((error) => { console.error('Error:', error) });
  };
              </code>
            </pre>

            <p>
              The corresponding php script could look like the following. Please
              make sure to adapt the folder paths and upload links to your own
              server and check the deploy script in the package.json.
            </p>

            <pre>
              <code>
&lt;?php
$jsonString = json_decode(file_get_contents('php://input'), true);
$data = $jsonString["data"];
$fname = $jsonString["fname"];
$time = date("Y-m-d-H-i-s");
file_put_contents('tangoCC-' . $fname . '-' . $time . '.json', $data, true);
echo '{ "success": true }';
?&gt;
              </code>
            </pre>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-question">
            Where will the study data be downloaded to?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              The study data exists of a CSV file and, if a webcam recording was
              selected, a WEBM file. The files will be stored in your Downloads
              folder (or the path you personally specified in your browser
              settings). If you want to change the download location, you can do
              so in your browser settings (please note that this change applies
              to all other downloads as well).
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3>Trouble Shooting</h3>

          <div class="faq-question">
            What if the device does not recognize the clicks / touch from
            children?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              Sometimes, the device is not sensitive enough to register the
              clicks. This is especially true for children who have a lighter
              touch. In this case, you can increase the sensitivity of your
              tablet device. For example, on a Microsoft Surface Pro, you can do
              this by going to the Windows settings, selecting "Devices", then
              "Pen &amp; Windows Ink", and then "Change the pen tip pressure
              sensitivity". You can also try to instruct the children to adjust
              their touch behavior: You might ask the children to adjust their
              strength or speed (clicking stronger and faster, for example).
              Sometimes it helps if they hold their finger the other way around
              (upside down) or press with their thumb.

          <div class="faq-question">
            The website did not save a webcam recording. What can I do?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              Please check your browser settings and allow the website to access
              your webcam. If you are using Safari, please note that Safari
              (especially on iOS) has issues with webcam recordings. Try another
              browser!
            </p>

          <div class="faq-question">
            What can I do if the website is not working?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>For the online version:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Ensure a stable internet connection.</li>
              <li>Turn on the sound/ volume of your device.</li>
              <li>Clean the cache of your browser and reload the website.</li>
              <li>
                Check your privacy settings and allow permissions to record via
                the webcam and download files.
              </li>
              <li>
                Please note that Safari (especially on iOS) has issues with

              </li>
              <li>
                We have noticed that the TANGO-CC is sometimes not working
                properly on Safari when browser extensions are enabled. For
                example, extensions like add blockers (e.g. UBlock Origin),
                password managers (e.g. 1Password) and typing assistants (e.g.
                Grammarly) might inject JavaScript which interferes with the
                task. In these cases, the task might load but the audio
                instructions do not play and clicks cannot be registered. Please
                try to disable all browser extensions and reload the page. It
                might be necessary to restart the browser. You can also try to
                open the website in a private window or another browser.
              </li>
              <li>
                In any case, it might be worthwile to try another browser or
                reload the page.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>For the offline version:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Please make sure the PWA is properly installed. The website
                needs a couple of minutes to complete cache of all its
                resources.
              </li>
              <li>
                Try opening the TANGO-CC with another browser. We recommend
                using a Chromium-based browser, e.g. Google Chrome or Microsoft
                Edge.
              </li>
              <li>
                You can test if the TANGO-CC is working offline by disconnecting
                from the internet and reloading the page.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              If you want to take a deep dive into the programming world, open
              up your browser's console and/or developer tools and see whether
              you get any error messages.
